        <!--pretty much whenever we use the float property we have to clear the float
        this can be fixed creating a blank div element with clear property with the value 
        of "both", otherwise we run into weird layout issues. But there's a problem with 
        this approach. This div is not descriptive or meaningful to search engines and 
        readers because we purely added this div to solved a layout issue so our HTML 
        markup is not semantic that is the problem in this approach.-->
        <!--<div class="clear"></div>--> 

        <!--There is another way of fixing this issue by using pseudo elements with 
        ::before and ::after pseudo elements we can add content before or after the
        content of an element. Before doing this let's comment out our div first.-->
